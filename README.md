These are all my assignments of the module CS5242 and there are one warm up and three assignments.

Warm up task is not graded, for another three assignment, and each one is 8% of full mark.

The structure of code:
CS5242 Neural Network and Deep Learning --- Warm Up|---------data
                                                   |---------util.py

                                                                 |----question_2_1
                                                       |-----Question_1
                                                       |-----Question_2
                                        --- Assignment2|
                                        --- Assignment3|


There are some logs about my assignments as follows:

8.30 Complete the warm up task. After watching the video on coursera, try to build my first neural network without hidden layer.

8.31 Complete assignment1 question1. use given w and b value of first neural network to calculate the w and b value of

the second neural network without hidden layers.
